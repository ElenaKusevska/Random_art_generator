To do: have this webpage look different at every every load, randomly choosing from one of three pallettes, to see if what the page looks like when it's loaded influences what the users choose.

Idea: gather data about what the users chose, what image they were shown, and how they felt about it, so that a learning algorithm can, over time learn how to give the users more and more pleasing images
